/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant security model where each tenant's data is isolated.
 *   Users are associated with tenants, and access is generally restricted to resources within their tenant.
 *   Additionally, a global "plans" collection exists for subscription plan definitions, accessible to all.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Maps user IDs to tenant IDs. This collection provides a fast way to determine which tenant a user belongs to.
 * - /tenants/{tenantId}: Stores tenant-specific information.
 * - /tenants/{tenantId}/*: Most data is nested under tenants, ensuring logical separation and preventing cross-tenant data access.
 * - /global/plans/{planId}: Contains publicly readable subscription plans.
 * - /mail/{mailId}: Used for triggering email sending. Write-only and restricted to the Firebase Extensions service account.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Tenant Isolation:  Most rules enforce that users can only access data belonging to their assigned tenant.
 * - User Listing Denied: Listing users within a tenant is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Plans Publicly Readable: Subscription plans are publicly readable to allow all users to view available options.
 * - Mail Collection Restricted: The /mail collection is write-only and should only be accessed by the Firebase Extensions service account.
 * - Flexible Data Shapes: The rules prioritize authorization over strict schema validation for prototyping speed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User-Tenant Mapping: The /users/{userId} collection directly maps user IDs to tenant IDs, avoiding the need to query the /tenants collection for basic authorization.
